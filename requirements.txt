Done on Production > Use PostgreSQL for your database from the beginning (not SQLite3), that way your deployment to Heroku will go much more smoothly. See the Heroku Docs for setup info.
> Users must sign in to see anything except the sign in page.
Done > User sign-in should use the Devise gem. Devise gives you all sorts of helpful methods so you no longer 
  have to write your own user passwords, sessions, and #current_user methods. See the Railscast 
  (which uses Rails 3) for a step-by-step introduction. The docs will be fully current.
> Users can send Friend Requests to other Users.
> A User must accept the Friend Request to become friends.
> The Friend Request shows up in the notifications section of a User’s navbar.
Done > Users can create Posts (text only to start).
> Users can Like Posts.
> Users can Comment on Posts.
> Posts should always display with the post content, author, comments and likes.
> Treat the Posts Index page like the real Facebook’s “Timeline” feature – show all the recent posts from the current user and users she is friends with.
> Users can create a Profile with a Photo.
> The User Show page contains their Profile information, photo, and Posts.
> The Users Index page lists all users and buttons for sending Friend Requests to those who are not already friends or who don’t already have a pending request.
> Sign in should use OmniAuth to allow a user to sign in with their real Facebook account. See the RailsCast on FB authentication with Devise for a step-by-step look at how it works.
> Set up a mailer to send a welcome email when a new user signs up. Use the letter_opener gem (see docs here) to test it in development mode.
> Deploy your App to Heroku.
> Set up the SendGrid add-on and start sending real emails. It’s free for low usage tiers.
